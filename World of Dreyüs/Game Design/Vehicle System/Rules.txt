Vehicle System


PCs and NPCs can crew various Roles on a vehicle, allowing them to use abilities to take Vehicle Actions.
	Example Roles: Navigator, Gunner/Gunnery Officer, Helmsman, Pilot, Engineer 
Unless the description of a vehicle states otherwise, individuals can only take 1 Vehicle Action per turn.
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\


Vehicle Actions - 
	Individuals can spend AP while crewing a vehicle to take various Vehicle Actions.

	Unless stated otherwise, individuals can typically only take one Vehicle Action per round.

	Vehicle Actions can result in the vehicle moving, attacking, or performing some other function.
	
	Rolls for Vehicle Actions resolve in three ways: Excellent, Inadequate, or Failure.
		Failure occurs when more than half of all dice rolled for a Vehicle Action roll a "1". If this happens, the vehicle
			does not perform its action at all or performs the action incorrectly in a non-beneficial way.
			When moving, a Failure causes the craft to misalign and not move, drifting with the wind if the vehicle is
				wind-driven.
			When attacking, a Failure causes the craft fail to attack due to malfunction and require 1 round to reset
				the weapons before being able to attack again.
		Inadequate occurs when no dice meet or exceed the threshold of the roll.
			The vehicle will either perform its action poorly, or perform in incompletely.
			When moving, the vehicle will move in the desired direction, but do so with a penalty.
			When attacking, the attack will miss.
		Excellent occurs when the threshold for the roll is met, and a Failure does not occur.
			The vehicle will perform the action correctly and to its best capability.

	Cooperative Rolls - Sometimes, particularly on Sky-ships, multiple individuals will make rolls to contribute to a 
			Vehicle Action.
			This most often occurs with Navigation Rolls, but can occur elsewhere, such as when multiple Engineers make
				Repair Rolls.
			
			When performing Cooperative Rolls all individuals must meet the threshold on their roles in order to achieve
				Excellent. 
			
			However, if an individual succeeds with multiple dice, they may choose one partner from the roll and have
				that partner's roll be considered successful as well. An individual may only do this for one partner
				at a time.    
			
			All individuals rolling as part of cooperative roll have their rolled 1's counted collectively and 
				compared against the total dice rolled in order to determine if it is a Failure instead.

Vehicle Roles:
	Engineer - Manages craft's technological systems.
		Typical Rolls:
			Altitude Change - On Size Class Medium and larger sky-ships an Engineer must make a 
				Navigation Roll (Acuity + Memory) seperate from the Navigator's and/or Helmsman's Navigation Rolls
				when the ship is changing altitude. The threshold for this roll is 6 plus the modifier from ship's 
				Lift-Drive Class.
			System Stabilization - When a ship's systems become "Critical" due to the ship's Damage value meeting its 
				Ship Health, an Engineer can make a Engineering Roll (Acuity + Memory) to attempt damage control
				and stabilize the affected systems. This removes the "Critical" status and it's associated penalties.
				Note: Anytime a ship is hit and its Damage meets or exceeds its Ship Health, the "Critical" status is
				applied, even if the a System Stabilization action succeeded previously. System Stabilization can be
				used again to remove the "Critical" status if reapplied, but it does not prevent the reapplication 
				of the status.
			Repairs - Outside of Combat, Engineers can lead the effort to repair a ship, lowering its Damage value.
				This roll can be made once per day, and the work associated with the roll occupies that day. 
				Engineers must have access to appropriate materials. The roll is affected by the number of
				individuals assisting in repairs.
					If the Engineer is alone, the roll is Engineering (Acuity + Memory), 
						but suffers from -2 Potential for the roll. (Potential cannot be reduced below 1.)
					If the Engineer has one assistant, the roll is Engineering (Acuity + Memory), but suffers
						but suffers from -1 Potential for the roll. (Potential cannot be reduced below 1.)
					If the Engineer is leading 2 or 3 others, the roll is Engineering (Acuity + Memory).
					If the Engineer is leading at least 4 others, the roll is Engineering (Charm + Memory),
						and gains a bonus to Potential for the roll equal to half the number of assistants.
				The threshold for this roll is always 6, and the Damaged reduced is equal to the combined value of
					successful dice.

	Gunner/Gunnery Officer - Operates a ships guns or directs auxillary crew in their use.
		Gunnery Rolls when the Gunner operates guns directly themself are Marksmanship (Acuity) Rolls.
			Note: this can be when the craft only has a single weapon, when a craft has fully automated gunnery, 
				or when their is insufficient crew to man a ship's gundecks.
		Gunnery Rolls when a Gunnery Officer directs crew members use of guns are Marksmanship (Acuity + Charm) Rolls.
			Note: only the Gunnery Officer needs to roll when these attacks are made.
		
		Typical Rolls:
			Shoot - Gunner attacks with the weapon system of the craft. Always a Marksmanship (Acuity) Roll.
				Note: This is the typical action when the craft possess a singular primary projectile weapon.
			Broadside Volley - Gunner or Gunnery Officer attacks with the broadside weapons to the port or starboard side.
				Receives bonus Potential equal to the ship's Broadside Power.
			Chaser Volley - Gunner or Gunnery Officer attacks with the chaser weapons in the ship's fore or aft direction.  
				Receives bonus Potential equal to the ship's Chaser Power.
	
	Helmsman - Operates the helm of a ship and directs the rigging crew, or operates the automated rigging system.
		The Helmsman is only a required role on ships with at least 3 masts. However, a Helmsman can be used seperately from
			a Navigator on smaller craft if there is enough crew members.
		
		A Helmsman can make Navigation (Acuity + Charm) Rolls to set a craft's course.
		
		On Size Class: Small ships, the Helmsman can combine the Engineer's roll for altitude changes into their own 
			Navigation roll instead of the Navigator or Engineer. 
		
		If a Helmsman must direct a manual rigging crew as part of the action, their roll becomes Navigation (Acuity + Charm).

Sky-ship Attributes:
	
	Build:
		Size Class	- Small, Medium, Large, Huge <- Describes general size of the ship, determines available 
					Sail Plans, Gun Classes, etc.
		Sail Plan	- Rigging layout, options differ per Size Class. Derives many other Ship Attributes.
		Hull Style	- Clinker or Carvel <- Affects cost, durability, and ability to have gundecks below the topdeck.
							Note: Limited to Small and Medium ships.
		Ship Width	- Narrow, Average, Wide <- Affects the following:
			Compartments Per Deck Change:
				Small: -2, 0, +2 
				Medium:
				Large:
				Huge:
			Navigational Difficulty Change:
				Small: -1, 0, +1
				Medium:
				Large:
				Huge:
			Construction Cost Change:
				Small: -500, 0, +500
				Medium:
				Large:
				Huge:
	
	Berth and Capacity:
		Deck Limit	- Maximum number of Decks a Sail Plan can have.
					Adding multiple decks increases the cost of a ship during construction, but also increases
						number of available compartments, maximum number of possible gundecks, and generally
						increases the size, value, and impressiveness of a ship.
		Deck Number	- The real number of decks on a constructed ship.
		Dedicated Hold 	- The number of compartments on a ship only usable as cargo space. Determined by Sail Plan.
					Unaffected by Deck Limit or Deck Number.
					1 compartment is about 1 tonne (metric) of capacity, or roughly a cubed meter of space.
						(Note: this is not an exact description of such a space, but a representation of
							the usable area of the space, i.e. the effective value. In reality the size 
							would likely be at least slightly larger.)
		Compartments
		Per Deck	- The number of compartments a ship has for each of its decks. Derives from Sail Plan and Ship Width.
		Compartment
		Number		- The real number of assignable compartments on a ship during construction. 
					Equal to Compartments Per Deck x Deck Number.
		Reserved 
		Compartments	- Total number of Compartments set aside for living spaces, lift drive, gunnery, 
					and other ship components such as Doctor's Cabin, Holding Cells, Workshops, Lancer Bays, etc.
					This value is subtracted from Compartment Number to determine the number of empty
					compartments added with Dedicated Hold when determining Cargo Space. 
		Berth		- Maximum number of people the craft can accomodate comfortably. 
					Increases by reserving compartments as Crew Spaces during construction.
					Crew Spaces: 
						Bunk Cabin 	- +5 Berth  | Space: 1 Compartment
						Officer Cabin	- +2 Berth  | Space: 1 Compartment
						Captain Cabin   - +1 Berth  | Space: 1 Compartment
						Bunk Deck 	- +10 Berth | Space: 2 Compartments
							Note: Ships will require 1 or more compartments reserved as Cabins, 
								representing a norm of ship construction, however any combination of
								cabins can be built to fulfil this requirement.
		Cargo Space	- Total cargo capacity of ship as a number of compartments. 
					Equal to the number of unreserved compartments 
						plus the number of compartments described by Dedicated Hold.
					1 compartment is about 1 tonne (metric) of capacity, or roughly a cubed meter of space.	
						(Note: this is not an exact description of such a space, but a representation of
							the usable area of the space, i.e. the effective value. In reality the size 
							would likely be at least slightly larger.)
					Additional Note: Unused cargo space can be used as makeshift living spaces to accomodate
						up to 5 individuals per compartment, but compartments used this way cannot hold
						cargo at the same time, and any individuals sleeping there should experience
						1d4 Stress Damage per day.

	Movement:
		Sky-Speed 	- Maximum movement speed while Reaching in the sky. While Downwind = 75%, Windward 50%	
		Surface-Speed	- Maximum movement speed while Reaching at the surface. While Downwind = 75%, Windward 50%	
		Navigational 
		Difficulty	- 3 values (Reaching, Downwind, and Windward) used as a modifier, being added to 3 
					to determine roll threshold for Navigator's and Helmsman's Navigation Rolls.
		Lift-Drive
		Class		- Relative power of Lift-Drive for the ship's Size Class
				 	Acts as a modifier to the Navigational Roll when changing altitude, 
						added to the base 3 used for Navigation Rolls.
					Low, Normal, High - +1, 0, -1
					Affects construction cost relative to the Ship's Size Class
						Small: -2000, 0, +2000
						Medium:
						Large:
						Huge:
					Note: on Small ships this affects the Navigator's singular Navigation Roll along with the 
						ship's Navigational Difficulty ONLY when changing altitude. Otherwise, the roll
						is only modified by Navigational Difficulty. 
						Engineer's dedicated Navigation Rolls when changing altitude on a Medium or larger
						ship is always modified by Lift-Drive Class alone, and never Navigational Difficulty. 
		Rigging Style - For ships of Size Class Medium or larger only, all Small ships are rigged as part of the singular
					Navigational Roll (Acuity + Memory) used when navigating Small ships. 		
				Manual or Automated. Dependent of whether or not automated system is installed.
					Automated	- Helmsman's Navigator Roll is Acuity
					Manual		- Helmsman's Navigator Roll is Acuity + Charm 
						(Note: if their is insufficient auxillary crew for Manual Rigging, PC's will 
							need to use AP to make additional Navigation Rolls to manually rig the sails.
							These rolls should be Acuity + Power.)
	
	Combat:
		Durability	- Derived from Sail Plan and affected by Hull Style, used to calculate Ship HP
		Ship HP		- 50 x Durability
		Lancer Bays	- Number of compartments set aside to allow Lancer deployment at altitude.
					Limited per deck by Size Class:
						Small: 2
						Medium:
						Large:
						Huge:	
		Full Gundeck(s)	- Contributes to Broadside Power and Chaser Power, requires 1/2 compartments on dedicated deck
		Half Gundeck(s) - Contributes to Broadside Power, requires 1/2 the compartments of a Full Gundeck
				Note: A ship CANNOT have multiple Gundecks, Full or Half, on a single deck of a ship, regardless of
					the number of available compartments.
		Broadside Power - Added Potential for Gunnery rolls from the side.
					Derived from the number of full and half gundecks: +2 per full, +1 per half.
						Note: can be 0 if craft has no gundecks at all, and therefore is unable to attack.
		Chaser Power	- Added Potential for Gunnery rolls from the front or back.
					Derived from number of full gundecks: +1 per full.
						Note: can be 0 if craft has no full gundecks,
							and therefore is unable to attack forward or aft. 
		Gun Class	- Dice added as bonus damage to successful attacks with the craft's guns.
					Light	 - 2d10 Broad, 1d10 Chaser
					Moderate - 2d12 Broad, 1d12 Chaser
					Heavy 	 - 2d20 Broad, 1d20 Chaser
					Limited by Size Class.
						Small  - up to Light
						Medium - up to Moderate
						Large  - up to Heavy
					 	Huge   - up to Heavy
							Note: Huge craft get to roll 1 extra GC dice when hitting, 
								no matter their GC. (3 dice for broadside, 2 dice chaser)
		Gunnery Style	- For ships of Size Class Medium or larger only, all Small ships require only a single Gunnery Roll
					The Gunnery Roll on Small ships is always Acuity only.
				Manual or Automated. Dependent of whether or not automated system is installed.
					Automated	- Gunnery Roll is Acuity
					Manual		- Gunnery Roll is Acuity + Charm
						(Note: if their is insufficient auxillary crew for Manual Gunnery, PC's can only
							use half their Acuity, rounded down, as Potential for Attacks with the ship. 
							You recieve half the total bonus Potential from 
								Broadside or Chase Power, rounded down.
							You can only roll 1 dice for bonus damage from the ship's Gun Class.
							Bonus Damage dealt from 
								Gun Class is reduced to half the amount rolled, rounded down.)

	Other/Misc:
		
		Auxillary Crew
		Requirement	- Number of individuals required to man any manual rigging or gunnery on the ship.
					Differs by Sail Plan, Rigging Style, and Gunnery Style.
					Can be 0, requiring no additional crew.
					A ship's Berth should be increased to make room for auxillary crew by the addition of more
						Crew Spaces, as it is unlikely individuals can be convinced to join a ship with 
						insufficient Berth. Overly-stressed auxillary crew maybe prone to revolt.

		Accomodations	- Extra facilities a ship may contain beyond the basic necessities of operation.
					May include kitchens, medical facilities, armories, holding cells, workshops, etc.
