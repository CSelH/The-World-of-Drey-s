This game makes use of 4-sided, 6-sided, 8-sided, 10-sided, and 12-sided dice. In notation, these will be referenced in the normal 
XdY format, where X is the number of dice to be rolled, and Y is the number of sides those dice should have.

For instance, 1d4 refers to rolling one singular 4-sided dice, while 3d4 refers to rolling three 4-sided dice. 
5d12 would refer to five 12-sided dice, 4d8 is four 8-sided dice, 2d6 is two 6-sided dice, and so on. 



There a three kinds of dice rolls used in this game to determine the outcome of uncertain events.

These rolls are Action Rolls, Struggle Rolls, Vehicle Rolls, and Saves.

Action Rolls are made by a character when they attempt to perform some feat, such as attacking, crafting, or coercing.
	Characters choose to perform these rolls actively, and typically must expend Action Points in order to do so. 

Struggle Rolls are a variation of an Action Roll that can be made by a character whenever they lack the Ability or Potential to 
	perform a particular action. These rolls have a low success rate and are typically made only in desperation and with an
	expectation of failure. 

Vehicle Rolls are similiar to Action Rolls, and involve one or more characters performing certain duties as part of a crew.
	These rolls modify the basic Action Roll rules, and are described in the in the Vehicle System Rules section.
	For now, it is enough to know that they are simply Action Rolls for vehicles, rather than lone individuals.

Saves are rolls a character maybe forced to perform in order to determine if they succumb to some effect.
	These rolls are typically not chosen by the character, and instead are the result of something happening to the character.
	Saves should never require Action Points to perform. 




This section will describe the mechanics of Action Rolls and Saves.
Vehicle Rolls are described in the Vehicle System Rules section.

Action Rolls

Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A GM may call for a character to make a roll of this kind whenever the character is actively attempting to do something.

A normal Action Roll should involve a character attempting to use some Ability they possess to perform some related action.
	For example, a character might use their Marksmanship Ability to attempt to shoot a target, or use their First-Aid Ability
	to provide initial treatment to a wound.

Characters can only perform one Action Roll at a time, and must resolve any current actions before attempting a new one.

For Action Rolls, a character's player, or the GM in the case of NPCs, rolls one or more dice and compares the result of each to
the target threshold for the roll. Normally, the GM determines the threshold for the roll, and should use higher values to reflect
more difficult situations. Sometimes the threshold for a roll is predetermined, most notably in the case of attacking actions, where
the threshold is determined by the target's Defense. Occasionally Abilities will provide rules that determine thresholds for specific
actions.

Thresholds normally range from 2 to 12, representing the possible range of acheivable values. However, if the GM determines that
an action is so difficult that is either completely impossible or only possible under extraordinary circumstances, they may set 
a threshold higher than 12. 
The GM may tell players the threshold outright, or choose to withold the information. (Note: Player's normally should not be told a 
target's Defense unless their character learns or deduces that information.)






Success and Extra Successes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If one or more of the dice rolled give a value equal to or higher than the threshold, then the character performs the action
sucessfully. 
Only one successful dice is required to perform an action. If multiple dice succeed, the one with the highest value among them is 
used to perform the action. All successful dice after the primary one are called Extra Successes.

Extra Successes maybe used to increase the potency of the action, and sometimes can be used for additional effects. 
For instance, Damage done by attacks is equal to the value of the successful die, and the value of the Extra Successes can 
be added to the initial value.

Abilities may grant unique uses of Extra Successes for related actions, and will describe their uses and limitations.

If the GM determines it to be appropriate, Extra Successes can be used in ways not explicitly described, so long as it does not
conflict with or bypass the game's intended limitations. Use this as a tool to enhance roleplaying by thinking of dynamic and 
interesting functions that reflect the details of the situation. As a guideline, no dice should perform more than one function, each 
function should have roughly equivalent value, and the amount of different functions performed in one action should be limited to
a reasonable degree.
If considering a new way of using an Extra Success, familiarize yourself with the existing ways of doing so already described by
different Abilities to ensure there isn't a distinct overlap and to provide a reference for balancing the effect. 






Unsuccessful
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If none of the dice rolled for the action meet or exceed the threshold, then the GM determines if the character either fails to 
perform the action, or performs it in an unsuccessful way.






Openings and Mistakes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If one or more dice rolled as part of an Action Roll land on a 1, then the character experiences one or more Mistakes or Openings.
Mistakes and Openings represent some significant oversight, miscalculation, carelessness, or other error from the character.
Mistakes and Openings can occur during successful and unsuccessful actions. 

Openings occur whenever the character rolls a 1 for an action that is actively contested by at least one other character, such as in
combat or during a competition. Openings provide an opportunity for other character's to act in response to the initial action. 
Whenever Openings occur, the GM decides which character or characters get to act, but should prioritize the most relevant characters.
The chosen characters are given the option to expend Action Points up to the number of rolled 1s in order to perform their own
actions, which may involve their own Action Roll.

Actions taken during Openings resolve before the action that caused the Opening, and thus can affect the outcome of the initial 
action. For instance, if a character makes a successful roll for an attack against another character, but creates an opening and the
attacked character successfully uses a guard or parry action to increase their Defense, the original attack may not have a high 
enough roll to meet the target's new, elevated Defense. In this case, the original attack would then become unsuccessful.

Actions taken during Openings can themselves provoke Openings, but can only be taken advantage of by a third party, as the 
primary and secondary actions are still in the process of resolving.

Mistakes occur whenever a character rolls a 1 for an action when alone, or if an Opening is unreasonable or no characters are able
to act on an Opening. 
Mistakes take the form of direct errors on the part of the acting character. These occur most often when the character is 
obtaining information in some way, or when performing some isolated, uncontested action, such as attempting to coerce an individual
or crafting an item.
The GM determines the exact nature of any Mistakes, and should try to use them in a way that creates interesting complications
for the character. 
For instance, a Mistake might result in a character obtaining misleading or incorrect information, potentially in addition to 
correct information if the roll was a success. A character who makes Mistakes while attempting to sway a crowd may find a portion
of the crowd abandoning them or outright becoming hostile, even if another portion is in agreement with the character.
An artisan who makes too many Mistakes while crafting an object might find the quality of the object diminished and not 
up to their own expected standards. 






Ability Level and Potential
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The size and number of dice used for an Action Roll are determined by two aspects of a character: Ability Level and Potential.
	
	

Ability Level describes how proficient a character is with a particular Ability and determines the size of the dice a character may 
use for actions related to the Ability. There a four Ability Levels to describe a character's skill.

Each of the four levels have a name and corresponding dice size:
	1. Novice 	- d6
	2. Journeyman 	- d8
	3. Master	- d10
	4. Legend	- d12

If a character does not know a particular Ability, they are said to be Unskilled in that Ability.




Potential describes the character's upper limit of capability for a particular action, and determines the number of dice a character 
may use for the action. Potential is represented as value between 1 and 5. When deciding to perform an action, the character may 
choose to use a number of dice up to their Potential for the roll. So, if a character's Potential for a roll is 3, they may use 
1, 2, or 3 dice to determine the outcome of the action.

A character's Potential for a roll is determined by the value of one or more of the character's Attributes.

The Attribute or Attributes called for should reflect what qualities of the character the rolls relies upon.
For instance, coercing an individual through persuasiveness should call for a character's Charm, in order to reflect
the charismatic nature of the interaction. Likewise, lifting a heavy object would rely upons a character's Power, since it 
represents their raw physical strength. 

The more complex or detailed an action is, the more likely it should be to call for two Attributes rather than one.
This reflects the need for the character to rely on a combination of their qualities in order to do their best.
For instance, this is why regular attacks with the Melee Weapon Ability require Finesse + Power in order to reflect the need for both
strength and precision when making attacks of that nature. 
	
Abilities typically describe what Attribute or Attributes are required for a related action, and may vary slightly in different 
context. For instance, the Marksmanship Ability calls for Finesse and Acuity when shooting small arms, but requires Actuiy and Charm 
when directing fire from a crewed weapon instead. 

Since Abilities can be open-ended or even player-created, generic applcations of an Ability might be underdefined.

In these cases, the GM should assess what Attribute or Attributes make the most sense in context. The GM may take player input into
consideration, but will always retain the final decision.
 
For instance, if a player employs an Acrobatic Ability to attempt to jump a gap the GM might decide to simply call for the 
character's Speed in one instance, and then later decide to call for Speed and Finesse for a similiar jump to reflect
the necessity of the character to land in a particular way or at a particular spot in order to avoid some hazard, such as
a crumbling cliff or patch of ice.

If only one Attribute is called for, then the character's Potential for that roll is equal to their value for that Attribute.
	I.e. Potential = Attribute
	
If two Attribute are called for, the the character's Potential for that rolls is equal to half of the sum of their values for those 
Attributes, rounded down.
	I.e. Potential = ( Attribute "A" + Attribute "B" ) / 2 , rounded down. 

Normally, character's have a value of at least 1 for every Attribute, and therefor always have at least 1 Potential for any action. 
However, a character's Attributes or Potential might be lowered as the effect of some Status, such as having an Injury or being 
Panicked. In these cases it is possible for a character's Potential for a roll to be lowered below 1, and  whenever this occurs that 
character becomes unable to perform the regular Action Roll.




Order of Operations
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When a character attempts to use one of their Abilities to perform some action, the following steps occur:
