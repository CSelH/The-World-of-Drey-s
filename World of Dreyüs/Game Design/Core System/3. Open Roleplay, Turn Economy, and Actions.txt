Out of Combat

Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Whenever no Players are in combat, strict turn order is not required. Instead, normally the game follows the concept of "open 

The GM is free to control the game as they desire, deciding what is happening in world and what the consequences of the various
character's behaviours will be. If you are new to roleplaying or tabletop games in general, you can skip the following and instead
go down to the "Roleplaying Introduction" section below for a primer on roleplaying in a tabletop game. 

If you are familiar with tabletop roleplaying games then the general concept of open roleplay is likely already familiar, and so this
game will likely seem intuitive, and should mirror the normal roleplaying experience you are used to. You can expect to act through
your character, question the GM, and make dice rolls when the GM demands it. 

However, this game is meant to allow the GM a lot of freedom to run the roleplaying, and the game in general, however they desire, 
be it with or without turns, whether or not to allow one individual to "face" and lead social interactions on behalf of the party,
whether the party may split, etc. It is the GM's table, and their rules are paramount. So as always, make sure there is clear 
communication between the GM and the Players regarding what the expectations at the table will be, and if there are any special 
considerations. As with all social games, most conflict is rooted in unfulfilled expectations and miscommunication.

Turn-Based Gameplay

Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This game uses individual turns for each player and the GM whenever one or more Players are in combat, non-hostile conflicts, or 
whenever else the GM desires. If the GM controls multiple characters at once, especially during combat, they may have multiple 
turns in between the Players' turns depending on the scenario. 

During a character's turn, whoever controls that character can engage directly in roleplay, choose what the character will do, ask
questions to the GM, and are the only ones allowed to do so, with some exceptions. Each character active in the scenenario will
typically have a turn, with the set of all turns being referred to as a "round". A round can be said to last from the start of the 
turn of the first character to act until the the start of that same character's next turn.

Some situations allow a character to act when it is not their turn, typically as part of Openings provoked on other character's turns. 
A character acting outside of their turn should not be considered as having gained another turn, and should not affect any abilities 
or effects that are dependent on that character's turn starting or ending. 


Turn-Order and Initiative
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO



Initiative Roll
--
Whenever the game must transition from open roleplay to turn-based gameplay an Initiative Roll can be used to determine turn order.

If the GM calls for Iniative Rolls, such as at the start of combat or other turn-based scenarios, each character rolls 
1d4 and adds the sum of their Tenacity and Speed Attributes. 
(Initiative = 1d4 + Tenacity + Speed)

The value of each character's result is compared, and the character with the highest value goes first. Subsequent turns follow in
order of descreasing value from highest to lowest.
If any characters roll the same value, the character with the highest Tenacity goes before the others unless their Tenacity 
Attributes are equivalent, in which case the character with the highest Speed goes first. If any characters get the same result and 
share the same Tenacity and Speed values, then the GM determines who acts first.



Ambush and Surprise
--
Normally, when all or most of the involved characters are aware of one another and/or expecting conflict, all characters will
make an Initiave Roll. However, if one or more characters ambush or surprise their opponents with an unexpected action, then the
character or characters doing so go first in the turn order, with their beginning actions being considered their turn for that round.
(Note: if multiple characters encounter one another unexpectedly and immediately come into conflict, they will all make Initiative
Rolls in the normal way.)

When a conflict starts in this way, turn-order for the offensive characters is determined simply by the order in which they performed 
their starting actions. A well-planned ambush can leave the offensive characters with a distinct turn-order advantage, while a 
surprise attack made in haste or carelessness might yield significantly less benefit.

Characters typically can only start a conflict together in this way whenever they coordinate and prepare beforehand, this might
involve laying in wait, using a "go phrase" or signal of some kind, or waiting until a particular event occurs to que everyone to 
act at once. Other methods might be use, but must follow a clear and consistent reasoning that all involved characters are aware of
ahead of time. 

If one character simply surprises another spontaneously, the initiating character's allies can not participate if they did not 
reasonably anticipate the act and prepare a response ahead of time. In this case, those allies may only act in the way they 
determined ahead of time, and cannot modify those decisions. If a Player believes their character should act in this way, then they 
should describe the character's intentions to the GM before the other character acts. 

After the initiating character or characters perform their actions all other characters involved, friend and foe, make Initiative 
Rolls in the normal way, and the first among them begins their turn immediately.

Gameplay Actions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whenever a character wants to perform a specific act in the game, such as moving, attacking, or using an Ability, they must expend
a corresponding amount of Action Points and whoever controls the character can provide a description or roleplay the character's 
behaviour. 
There are two primary kinds of actions a character can make: Basic Actions and Ability Actions, both of which require the character
to expend Action Points. 


Action Points
--
TODO
In order to perform Basic Actions or Ability Actions a character must expend a one or more Action Points as noted in the action's 
description. 
The number of total Action Points a character can have is equal to 1 plus the character's Speed Attribute ( 1 + Speed ), with the
maximum possible being six (6) Action Points. 
All of character's Action Points are restored at the start of their turn
