Trib-guns
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Typically player characters that use ranged weapons will have access to trib-guns as their default option. These are the standard
among any scavcycling culture, and traditional weapons are seen mostly in specific situations. Trib-guns do, however, have some
properties that differentiate them from traditional projectile weapons. Some special rules govern how those properties are 
represented in the game mechanics:


The Triboelectric Drive, Charging Shots, and Modifications
-----

Trib-guns derive their name from their power source: triboelectric drives. These are relatively simple devices that generate an 
electric current from the moving contact of two surfaces. Trib-guns use a hand-crank to provide a source of rotational movement,
storing the resulting charge from the triboelectric drive in capacitors before being discharged to power the laser-gun.

Characters wielding a trib-gun must expend 1 AP and use one free hand to generate enough charge for a shot. Once charged the trib-gun 
will remain ready to fire until the end of the character's next turn. Once the trib-gun is fired it loses its charged state, 
requiring it to be recharged before another shot can be made.

This is the standard for most trib-guns, however some Abilities and equipment available to characters can change this interaction.
Special heavy weapons may require extra charging, gunslingers can make use of rigs that allow for the charging of multiple trib-guns
simultaneously, and engineers have the potential to create specialized drives for storing charges longer or allowing for multiple
charges to be stored at once. 


Energy-based Attack
-----

As mentioned in the Armor rules in section 7, some attacks are considered Energy-based for the purpose of Armor Mitigation.
Energy-based attacks are treated as melee attacks when determining damage reduction from Armor Mitigation, meaning they will deal
more damage than regular ranged attacks.

Trib-guns, being a laser weapon, inherently deliver an Energy-based attack. 
Be sure to use the correct Armor Mitigation value when calculating damage from the laser shot of any trib-gun.



Destruction and Injuries
-----

The laser produced by trib-guns are incredibly powerful, and there is always some consequence to pulling the trigger on a charged 
weapon. 

Materials hit by the laser could be ignited, blasted away, or even vaporized depending on the material. Some anti-laser materials
can be found, but are often expensive and only available im limited amounts. 

Bladed or blunt melee weapons can lead to fairly intuitive Injuries, such as concussions, lacerations, broken bones, or even 
amputations. The lasers produced from Trib-guns do not want for similiar capability. Injuries from trib-guns could see victims suffer
severe burns, destroyed flesh, even vaporized or otherwise destroyed limbs and organs.

Consumables
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some items may have limited or one-time uses that provide specific effects. Typically a character will have to expend one or more AP
in order to use the item, consuming it gain its benefits. 

The following is a non-exhaustive list of some example consumables, as well as their specific rules, that players may commonly
encounter:







Traumapak
-----

More of a general term than a standardized product, traumapak is the common name for a kind of battlefield first-aid kit that is 
useful for temporarily preventing damaged characters from dying or recieving an Injury. Normally traumapaks are a combination of
anesthetic, coagulant, sterilizer, and temporary field dressing. Rudimentary traumapaks might consist of seperate substances and 
materials used in conjunction, such as individual painkillers, iodine ampules, and fabric bandages. Cultures with more advanced
medical technology are capable of producing traumapaks that take the form of a singular multi-function substance that can be applied
as a fluid over an area before rapidly solidifying, creating an immediate, if temporary, bandage designed to be easily removed later
via exposure to concentrated amounts of light at specific frequencies. 

Regardless of the specific makeup, characters will use any given traumapak for the same purpose.
Players can expend 2 AP to make a Medicine(Acuity + Memory) Action Roll to attempt to use a traumapak to give the Stabilized status
to a Wounded or Dying character. The threshold for this roll is 4, and the traumapak is only consumed when the roll succeeds.
The Item Quality level modifier for the traumapak can be applied as a roll modifier to one of the dice rolled for this action.






M-fab Resupply Pods
-----

These modular containers contain a variety of raw materials necessary for m-fab function and are a standard design dating back 
millenia to the peak of m-fab innovation. While occasionally scavenged, the simplicity of the design has resulted in nearly every
technology inclined culture reverse engineering the design and establishing some sort of production of their own. 


Characters may expend 1 AP and make a Basic Action to fully refill the Material Pool of their m-fab with a Resupply Pod. Regardless 
of how much material is restored, the Resupply Pod is fully consumed upon use. 



Resupply Pods can be relatively easily purchased, and some engineers can use raw materials and a workstation to produce Ressuply Pods.
