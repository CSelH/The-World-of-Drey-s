

Attributes are the primary stats of the system.



They are represented as integer values from 1 to 5, with 1 being the minimum a character may have, representing a "below average"
	human ability, and 5 five being the maximum they might have, representing a "near super-human" ability.



Derived stats such as a character's Health, Defense, Action Points, and Carry Weight are derived from Attributes.



Attributes also determines the character's Potential, or the available number of dice, for an associated roll.
	Some simple actions, such as moving a heavy object or recalling a piece of information, may rely on one Attribute alone,
		In these cases, Potential is equal to the associated Attribute. 
			E.g. Move Object (Power) or Recall (Memory), Potential = Power or Memory.
	More skilled or complex actions, such as attacking or operating a device or machine, may rely on a combination of two 
		different Attributes.
		In these cases, Potential equals half the sum of the two Attributes.
			E.g. Markmanship (Finesse + Acuity) or Engineering (Acuity + Memory), 
				Potential = (Finesse + Acuity) / 2 or (Acuity + Memory) / 2. 
	
	This means that more complicated and difficult actions will require characters to develop their capability in multiple fields.
	Likewise simpler actions are less demanding on a character's capability, and thus be performed more consistently at first. 




All characters start with a "1" in each Attribute, with the character's class providing a starting a bonus of +1 or +2 to different
	Attributes related to the class's archetype. 



Character's can raise their Attributes via Experience Points earned through significant accomplishments.

		Represents a character's ability to withstand physical damage.

	Damage: Counterpart to Health.

			Whenever Damage reaches or exceeds a value equal to twice a character's Health, they are considered Dieing.
			Whenever Damage increases when a character is Dieing, they permanantly die.
			Dieing characters must roll 1d6 at the end of each of their turns, if the result is higher than their Heartiness, they permanently die.
