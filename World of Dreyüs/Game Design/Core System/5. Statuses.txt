

Character Statuses are various states a character can be in, causing harmful or beneficial effects while character has the Status.



Wounded: Applied when Damage increases and the result is equal to or higher than the character's Health.
	Wounded characters have a -1 Potential on all actions.
	Wounded characters must roll 1d6 whenever their Damage increases, if the result is higher than their Heartiness 
		they receive an Injury. This roll is called the Injury Save.
	The Wounded status is removed automatically if Damage is lowered to a value that is less than the character's Health.



Dying: Applied when Damage increases and the result is equal to or higher than twice the character's Health.
	Dying characters become permanantly dead if their Damage increases.
	Dying characters must roll 1d6 at the end of each of their turns, if the result is higher than their Heartiness
		they permanently die. This roll is called the Death Save.
	The Dying status is removed automatically if Damage is lowered to a value that is less than twice the character's Health.


Stabilized: Applied to Wounded or Dying characters by some medical treatments, particularly Traumapaks or medical m-fab Techniques.
	Whenever a Wounded character that is Stabilized fails an Injury Save, the Injury is prevented and the Stabilized condition
		is removed.
	Whenever a Dying character that is Stabilized takes damage or fails a Death Save, they do not die and the Stabilized
		condition is removed.



Injury: Can be applied when a character fails the Injury Save, or when a single attack increases a character's Damage by an amount 
		equal to or greater than half the Character's Health.

	Injuries are permanant physical maladies that can impart various penalties. 
	Medical aid and technology can help reverse, counteract, or occassionally overcome an Injury.
	However, advanced medicine is not universal in Drey√ºs, nor without complications.

	Injuries:
		
		Eye 		| -1 Acuity
		Face		| -1 Charm
		Head		| -1 Memory
		Arm		| -1 Power
		Hand		| -1 Finesse
		Leg/Foot	| -1 Speed

	These injuries should be considered severe. Eye, arm, hand, leg, and foot injuries should involve either the loss of the 
		body part or significant enough damage to inhibit its functionality. Head injuries should be at least severe
		concussion, and probably involve significant damage to the brain. Face injuries should be disfiguring in an 
		unsettling way, and could even involve loss of bone mass from the skull or jaw. 

	Determining what body part is injured can be done in several ways. Attackers may choose to attack specific targets, and
		the GM may determine if those targets are damaged if the attacker rolls decently enough. Otherwise, the GM may
		decide what injury occurs in whatever way they choose, such as simply selecting one that fits the story and scenario
		or utilizing dice to determine one at random. 



Shaken: Applied when Stress increases and the result is equal to or higher than the character's Control.
	
	Shaken characters have a -1 Potential on all actions.



Panicked: Applied when Stress increases and the result is equal to or higher than twice the character's Control.
	
	Panicked characters must roll 2d6 at the start of each of their turns,
		
		if both dice land on a value higher than the character's Tenacity, they suffer a -3 Action Point penalty for the turn.
		
		If only one dice lands on a value higher than the character's Tenacity, they suffer a -1 Action Point penalty for 
			the turn instead.
		
		If no dice land on a value higher than the character's Tenacity, they suffer no Action Point penalty for the turn.
	This roll is called the Panic Save.


Unconcious: Applied when Stress increases and the result is equal to or higher than three times the character's Control.
	Unconcious characters cannot act or move, and their Defense becomes 1.
	Unconcious characters can be awoken by an allies Medicine (Acuity + Memory) roll.
		The threshold for this roll is always 3, on success the unconcious character awakens and the status is removed.
		However, this roll does not reduce the character's Stress, leaving the character vulnerable 
			to the Unconcious status if their Stress increases again.	


Burdened: Applied when a character carries an amount greater than their Carry Weight.
	Burdened characters cannot use the Sprint action or any action with the Attack Tag, but may use the Move action.
	Abilities might specifiy limitations for Burdened characters.
