Out of Combat
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Whenever no Players are in combat, strict turn order is not required. Instead, normally the game follows the concept of "open 

The GM is free to control the game as they desire, deciding what is happening in world and what the consequences of the various
character's behaviours will be. If you are new to roleplaying or tabletop games in general, you can skip the following and instead
go down to the "Roleplaying Introduction" section below for a primer on roleplaying in a tabletop game. 

If you are familiar with tabletop roleplaying games then the general concept of open roleplay is likely already familiar, and so this
game will likely seem intuitive, and should mirror the normal roleplaying experience you are used to. You can expect to act through
your character, question the GM, and make dice rolls when the GM demands it. 

However, this game is meant to allow the GM a lot of freedom to run the roleplaying, and the game in general, however they desire, 
be it with or without turns, whether or not to allow one individual to "face" and lead social interactions on behalf of the party,
whether the party may split, etc. It is the GM's table, and their rules are paramount. So as always, make sure there is clear 
communication between the GM and the Players regarding what the expectations at the table will be, and if there are any special 
considerations. As with all social games, most conflict is rooted in unfulfilled expectations and miscommunication.

Turn-Based Gameplay
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This game uses individual turns for each player and the GM whenever one or more Players are in combat, non-hostile conflicts, or 
whenever else the GM desires. If the GM controls multiple characters at once, especially during combat, they may have multiple 
turns in between the Players' turns depending on the scenario. 

During a character's turn, whoever controls that character can engage directly in roleplay, choose what the character will do, ask
questions to the GM, and are the only ones allowed to do so, with some exceptions. Each character active in the scenenario will
typically have a turn, with the set of all turns being referred to as a "round". A round can be said to last from the start of the 
turn of the first character to act until the the start of that same character's next turn.

Some situations allow a character to act when it is not their turn, typically as part of Openings provoked on other character's turns. 
A character acting outside of their turn should not be considered as having gained another turn, and should not affect any abilities 
or effects that are dependent on that character's turn starting or ending. 



Gameplay Actions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whenever a character wants to perform a specific act in the game, such as moving, attacking, or using an Ability, they must expend
a corresponding amount of Action Points and whoever controls the character can provide a description or roleplay the character's 
behaviour. 
There are two primary kinds of actions a character can make: Basic Actions and Ability Actions, both of which require the character
to expend Action Points.
